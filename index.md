# Gibson ES-335, the first successfull semi-hollow electric guitar

The Gibson ES-335 is the world's first commercial semi-hollowbody electric guitar,
It is neither fully hollow nor fully solid; instead, a solid maple wood block runs
through the center of its body. The side "wings" formed by the two "cutaways"
into its upper bouts are hollow, and the top has two violin-style f-holes over
the hollow chambers.

## The Features
* looks like an arche top
* sounds warm and round
* can be played lound without feedback
* is extremly versatile
